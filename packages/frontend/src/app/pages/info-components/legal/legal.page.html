  <p>
    RecipeSage has several wonderful sharing features that allow you to share
    &amp; collaborate with other users.<br />

    share content that you have the license to, including (but not limited to):
    any text content of the recipe, images, notes, and title.<br />

    fine line here. We expect that you as the user will follow fair use laws,
    and will do your best not to use RecipeSage to share copyrighted content
    that you don't have the rights to.

    copyrighted content present publicly, for example on your profile, we will
    need to take action. We'll always notify you if this is the case. Our
    actions may include (but are not limited to): removing the copyrighted
    content from your public profile or disabling your public profile
